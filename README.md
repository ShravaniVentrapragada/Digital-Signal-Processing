Discrete Signal:We have generated discrete signals using our previous knowledge of folding, shifting commands from Signals and Systems and obtained desired outputs.


Convoulution Signals: Using For loop and without using inbuilt function we convoluted two signals, once cascaded, once parallel and once normally convoluting. We obtained desired Outputs.


Nyquist Rate: When an analog signal is digitized, any component of the signal that is above one-half the sampling or digitizing frequency will be 'aliased.' This frequency limit is known as the Nyquist frequency. In the above experiment we performed matlab code to form signals with this principle. as time decreases pitch increases this frequency(8000) is not getting alised and the new frequenies are 600,700,500 which are beyond 300 which is the folding frquency. which is given by the formula - Fs/2<F<Fs/2. In the above experiment we created a piano using matlab and the method of alising of frequency we even made two songs (Twinkle Twinkle and london bridge) to check whether our code worked or not.


Filter Function: function to find the total response of the differential equation and to obtain desirable outputs.
